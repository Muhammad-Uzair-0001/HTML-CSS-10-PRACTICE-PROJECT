          <p>
            <b>Abdul Qadeer Khan</b>, NI, HI, FPAS KAH-deer KAHN; Urdu: عبد
            القدیر خان; 1 April 1936 – 10 October 2021),[3] known as A. Q. Khan,
            was a Pakistani nuclear physicist and metallurgical engineer who is
            colloquially known as the "father of
            <b> Pakistan's atomic weapons program".[a] An émigré (Muhajir)</b>
            from India who migrated to Pakistan in 1952, Khan was educated in
            the metallurgical engineering departments of Western European
            technical universities where he pioneered studies in phase
            transitions of metallic alloys, uranium metallurgy, and isotope
            separation based on gas centrifuges. After learning of India's
            "Smiling Buddha" nuclear test in 1974, Khan joined his nation's
            clandestine efforts to develop atomic weapons when he founded the
            Khan Research Laboratories (KRL) in 1976 and was both its chief
            scientist and director for many years.
